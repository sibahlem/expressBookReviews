In this final project, we will build a server-side online book review application and integrate it with a secure REST API server which will use authentication at the session level using JWT.
You will then test your application using Promises callbacks or Async-Await functions.


Objectives:
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-Create APIs and perform CRUD operations on an Express server using Session & JWT authentication.
-Use Async/Await or Promises with Axios in Node.js.
-Create REST API endpoints and test them using Postman.

npm install --save
npm install
npm start
*don't forget to not back up the node_module folder to GitHub

put review code sample:
regd_users.put("/auth/review/:isbn", async (req, res) => { // "customer/auth/review/1" for PUT request
  const username = req.session.authorization.username	

  const isbn = req.params.isbn;
  let filtered_book = books[isbn]
  if (filtered_book) {
      let review = req.query.review;
      let reviewer = req.session.authorization['username'];
      if(review) {
          filtered_book['reviews'][reviewer] = review;
          books[isbn] = await filtered_book;
      }
      res.send(`The review for the book with ISBN  ${isbn} has been added/updated.`);
  }  else{
      res.send("Unable to find this ISBN!");
  }
});


The code we use fetches the review from the HTTP request query (not the body).
If you are using that, please select the "Params" option on Postman, and enter the key as "review" and the value as your actual review.
